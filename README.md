# Arduino-UNO-R3---Temperature-Sensor-Love-O-Meter-
This is a simple project using an Arduino UNO R3 and a TMP36 temperature sensor to measure temperature based on skin and air contact. The sensor sends out a variable voltage depending on the heat it detects, and the Arduino reads that value using its analog input (ADC).
